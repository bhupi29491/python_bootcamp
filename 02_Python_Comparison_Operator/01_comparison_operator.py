# There are different types of comparison operator available in Python

# == (Equality)
# If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.
# print(2 == 2)   # O/P : True
# print(2 == 1)   # O/P : False
# print('hello' == 'bye')   # O/P : False
# print('Bye' == 'bye')   # O/P : False
# print(3.0 == 3)   # O/P : True


# != (Not Equality)
# If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true.
# print(2 != 2)   # O/P : False
# print(4 != 2)   # O/P : True

# >	(Greater than)
# If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
# print(2 > 1)   # O/P : True
# print(2 > 7)   # O/P : False

# <	(Lesser than)
# If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
# print(1 < 5)   # O/P : True
# print(20 < 7)   # O/P : False

# >=	(Greater than or Equal to)
# If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
# print(2 >= 2)   # O/P : True
# print(2 >= 7)   # O/P : False

# <	(Lesser than or Equal to)
# If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
# print(1 <= 5)  # O/P : True
# print(20 <= 7)  # O/P : False
